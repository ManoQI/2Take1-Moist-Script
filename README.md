# ** Script Changes Additions and Fixes **

* Added 15k CEO Loop

   `works for Associates in other Organisations or Associates of yours`


* Changed Rapid Switch RPG
    
    `<Standard RPG | Special RPG> `
 
  (special has very far range lifetime so travels further without hitting something before exploding)


* Updated Online Ped Spawn Options

  Basic Integrity check added to check that all options prior to them selves have been selected if not notify will popup showing which have been selected or not to prevent breaking the script

* Added function: Saved Settings Check which will create a default settings file before executing the main function of the script
  (this will fix the issues some people have when first executing the script)

* Added: New Experimental God Modder Check
  (Runs independent to other checks and works best if you have an expanded Radar there is option to change the function for normal or expanded, Normal Radar requires you to be outside of any interior)
  Notify's for this contain the god mode return result for both player and vehicle if either were detected after 2 delayed checks

* Added: Crash ScriptEvent Kick (Online Player Feature)
  (uses my script event argument builder to create kick/crash using known events)

* Added 2 troll/griefing options: Online Features -> Online Session
  1. Send Mk1 Lester Wandering by all
  2. MK1 Lester Annihilation

* Fixed: Incorrect Bounty Tagging

* Fixed: Auto-Remove RAC-Modder Marking
  (Now Removes the correct tag)

* Updated: OSD Speed for self Now indicates:
  Current Speed/Estimated Vehicle Max Speed

* Added: Temporarily 2x Interior & God Check Versions
  * version 1 the older God Check version & interior check which did not spam detection's

  * version 2 the newer ones might still be a little spammy but the blip checks in Theory should reduce the false notify's


* Added- Netevent logging for player spawn
        this is now used to determine if player is in an interior loaded into the session and not on death screen (note this may well cause the index feat error with everything if you reset state too much)


* Added- section **  V1.40 Functions **
        Found inside Script options (some features from my old 1.40 script no longer in v2)
        
* Added- OSD Spectate in V1.40 Functions
        Will show on screen someone not in a detectable interior spectating any other player and will show you who they are spectating no saveable option for this its default on
        
* Updated- Rapid Weapon Switch and RPG Switch
        More checks added to these to prevent crash
        
* Added- New Blip Pulse Option
        Runs on playerlist loop hidden as u have no control over it other than having the old option on or not
        
* Added- New Godmode Check
        Since detection of entity speed is something else limited in range i have added a check that is turned on when god mode and on a delay will check the players location and compare to its original location
        if its over the value it will trigger a notify. (player accepting invite to heist (teleport to apt) this could potentially trigger false positive needs further testing)
      
* Updated- Vehicle RPM Reduced the size
  
* Added- Attach Vehicle to Mine
        Attaches to your selection: Attach to Vehicle or Attach to Ped
        Attaches and sets their alpha to 80 detaches and resets alpha when off

* Updated- SE Spam with more delays to prevent crash

* Updated Combat Features- Added Sub Sections to them:
                        Player Ped Combat Features
                        Vehicle Combat Features

* Added- Vehicle Weapon Fire which can be positioned with the controls in here its designed mainly for aircraft

* Updated- 2 Orbital Blocks:
  * New Orbital Blast Door
  * Moving Wall Orbital Block

    `These can now be done remotely with ease no need to spectate
you will be teleported to the location block will be built then you get teleported back to original location this is so fast your character twitches for a second
objects are now world objects + mission objects and set to god
`

* Added- option to disable Script created Blips so all functions that use this have been updated with a check for that setting

* updated- some SE functions

* Update- toggle off Vehicle God -> Now is: Force Control & God Mode OFF and does exactly what it says so could be used to force control over their vehicle for other stuff too

<hr>
Script is executed in 2 parts which both are executed in a protected call so should stop shit breaking in other scripts i hope and started to do this to other functions to hopefully stop the break generating spammy errors if they happen
<hr>


* Disabled- Player Checks and Playerinfo box
        cant be sure but im certain crash related to getting weapon info while in a vehicle (major menu bug) still causing this
        its random since it could potentially be passed my checks for vehicle or having an attachment just as they get in a vehicle so disabled until i can investigate further

* Added- Blip cleanup when resetting state
* Added- Force Orbital block

   (works off the blast door block and loops control and position 
update on it)


* (^) Updated Attach Options:

  all but the room attaches are now select-able attach to players ped or Players vehicle (if no attach entity nothing will happen to avoid any breaks when no vehicle exists or detectable)

* (+) Added Attach Options:

* (+) Added Attach FIB Building

  (note that this will trigger 2t1's modder detection when attaching to peds! False invalid world object and invalid attach attempts or crash attempts on whoever is close when you are near it or spectating)

* (+) Added Attach Dooms Day Sub
Similar situation with the FIB Attach and false modder detection's

* (+) Added 2 New Script Event Crashes to Online Player Features

* (-) Hidden empty vehicle tools in Online Player Features

* Removed the delays in the Player list loop
Player bar updates faster now

* Added Save-able option for the Orbital Proximity Blip.

* Updated the Spawn Vehicle Triplets

  `Now sorted into Alpha Sub Functions
Vehicle Hash LUA updated for this will break the script if you dont update this file too.`
